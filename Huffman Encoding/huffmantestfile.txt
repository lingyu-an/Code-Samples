Contradiction 1
by Rick Brunet

There once was a man.  He was a good man.

In his middle years, the man was considered by all who knew him friend.  He had
no enemies, no evil inside him, no "debts to society".  Only good came from
him, and only good came back to him.  A full circle of light.

The man had a woman, a woman he had known half his life, who loved and
cherished him, and that he loved and cherished in kind.  He was her knight in
shining armour, and she was his his Guinivere.	Together they shared a
happiness, a contentment in their own little Garden of Eden.

All was good in this man's life.  This man died at the ripe old age of
forty-nine.

Did God "call him home"?  Was this man's purity and shining strength so solid
that it could no longer be kept apart from His Paradise?  Did the very
"foundation of heaven" scream for this man's Soul?  No.

You see, he had a particular fondness for eggs as his breakfast meal.  By the
time he hit forty, the cholestorol levels in his body had built up to dangerous
levels.  What do Saints know of doctors?  But then again, what does Life know
of Saints.

And so, the man died of a heart attack at the ripe old age of forty-nine.  Only
sick minds would think he was condemned to Hell for being a fool.

God is not that human.
